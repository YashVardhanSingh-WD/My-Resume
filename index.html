    <h2>Summary</h2>
    <p>
        I am a web developer who enjoys creating clean, user-friendly websites that feel natural and easy to use. I
        focus on writing well-structured code and building solutions that are reliable, scalable, and simple to maintain
        over time. Performance, responsiveness, and cross-device compatibility are always a priority in my work.

        I believe good web development is not just about making things work, but about creating experiences that users
        can trust and enjoy. By balancing functionality with usability, I aim to deliver digital products that are
        practical, efficient, and genuinely helpful.
